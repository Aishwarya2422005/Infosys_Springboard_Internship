# **Air Quality Index (AQI) Visualization Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**

The **Air Quality Index (AQI) Visualization Dashboard** is an interactive tool that allows users to explore and analyze air quality data across **India** from **2020 to 2022**. The platform provides insights into the trends, regional disparities, and impact of key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO in cities across India. This project is aimed at **environmental analysts**, **policymakers**, and the **general public**, helping them make data-driven decisions related to air quality management and public health.

### **Key Features**

- **AQI Trends Over Time**: Visualize the evolution of air quality across India over multiple years, with detailed temporal analysis.
- **Monthly Trends in AQI**: Explore seasonal variations and identify months with high pollution levels.
- **Pollutant Contributions**: Understand the impact of major pollutants like **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **CO**, **SO2**, **NO2**, **O3**, and **CO** on the AQI.
- **City-Specific Analysis**: Analyze localized trends, pollution sources, and AQI levels across various cities in India.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Navigate through dynamic charts, graphs, and maps for an in-depth exploration of air quality data.
- **Trend Comparisons**: Compare AQI trends across cities, states, and regions for detailed insights.

This platform empowers users to track air quality fluctuations, identify pollution hotspots, and draw actionable insights to address air pollution challenges in India.
